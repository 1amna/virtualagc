    <h2><small><big>Where is the Apollo Project Documentation?</big><br>
      </small></h2>
    <div style="text-align: left;"> While the <a href="links.html">available
        online documentation</a> is helpful and interesting, it is only
      a tiny fraction of the documentation produced by the Apollo
      project.&nbsp; So where is the rest of it?<br>
      <br>
      I don't actually know the full answer to the question posed
      above—for example, I don't currently know where many versions of
      the AGC source code is stored.&nbsp; (Probably somewhere in the
      musty depths of Draper Labs, never to be viewed again by mortals
      such as you or I.)&nbsp; But I do know where <span
        style="font-style: italic;">a lot</span> of documentation is
      hiding.&nbsp;<br>
      <h2>The Wonders of N.A.R.A.</h2>
      A lot of U.S. government documentation is not thrown away, but
      rather is eventually retired to the <a href="http://www.nara.gov">National
        Archives and Records Administration</a> (NARA).&nbsp; NARA
      maintains a number of centers about the country, in which the
      records for the geographical region associated with that center
      are stored.&nbsp; I happen to live in Dallas, Texas, and since the
      Johnson Space Center (JSC)—formerly the Manned Spacecraft Center
      (MSC)—is in the vicinity of Houston, my first hope was that
      perhaps JSC may have preserved some of the Apollo
      documentation.&nbsp; Well, perhaps JSC has preserved such
      documentation—the extensive historical archive search engine on
      their website certain implies that they have!—but I was advised by
      the NASA history office that JSC's documentation would long since
      have been sent to the NARA center for the Southwest Region, which
      happens to be in Forth Worth, Texas, a mere hour from
      Dallas.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went over and looked.<br>
      <br>
      It's difficult to believe the quantity of Apollo-related
      documentation to be found at NARA's Southwest Region center.&nbsp;
      The NARA archivists measure it by shelf-foot rather than by
      document or by number of pages.&nbsp; I can only assume that the
      amount of Apollo-related documentation lurking at the other NARA
      centers is equally staggering.<br>
      <h2>Indiana Jones<br>
      </h2>
      Normally, when you visit NARA, you're expected to know what you're
      looking for, so that the archivists can pull it from the stacks
      for you.&nbsp; In other words, researchers such as myself are not
      allowed in the stacks.&nbsp; I was lucky enough not to know
      exactly how to describe what I was looking for—namely, the AGC
      source code—but to know what it would look like when I saw it, so
      I had the privilege of being escorted into the stacks briefly for
      a visual survey of the MIT-related Apollo records.&nbsp; It was
      much like the final scene in <span style="font-style: italic;">Raiders
        of the Lost Ark</span>, where the ark of the covenant is wheeled
      into a vast warehouse where it can never be found again.&nbsp; The
      main difference, though, is that NARA stacks are more packed and
      not so open and airy as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Raiders</span>
      warehouse.&nbsp; The NARA personnel (at least in the Southwest
      region) are, however, very friendly, and very eager to help you
      find what you are looking for.&nbsp; I've never had any experience
      with governmental entities as pleasant as my experiences at NARA.<br>
      <h2>"Record Group 255"<br>
      </h2>
      A summary of the records transferred to NARA-Southwest from the
      Johnson Space Center—so-called Record Group 255—can be seen (in
      Microsoft Word format) by <a href="NARA-SW/Rg255-1.doc">clicking
        here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you examine this summary, you'll find
      that the records for the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office—and
      these aren't all of the Apollo-related records, by any means—total
      an astounding 730 <span style="font-style: italic;">feet</span>
      of shelf space.&nbsp; (For some reason, the document linked above
      seems to double estimates of shelf-space, so you have to halve
      most of the estimates to get an accurate idea.)<br>
      <br>
      Record Group 255 is subdivided into groupings identified by "entry
      numbers".&nbsp; Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) data begin
      at entry number E.205T5 ("general subject files") and end with
      entry number E.216 ("microfilm aperture cards of drawings"), but
      Apollo-related information may be found in many other groupings as
      well.&nbsp; Each grouping is itself subdivided into a sequence of
      boxes; most of the boxes are 4" thick (i.e., capable of holding a
      4"-thick stack of documents), though some boxes (like those
      holding "drawings" or microfilm) are much bigger.<br>
      <br>
      Since M.I.T.'s Instrumentation Lab developed the AGC software, it
      seems logical to look for AGC data within the records designated
      E.209G, "Massachusetts Institute of Technology
      Documents"—fortunately, only 20 feet of shelf space.&nbsp; The
      records within E.209G were never fully indexed when transferred
      from JSC to NARA, so I have prepared my own index, which you can <a
        href="NARA-SW/IndexOfNaraBox209G.html"> view by clicking here</a>.&nbsp;
      The records for E.209G are stored in 59 four-inch-thick boxes, so
      to find any particular document, you need to know which box it is
      in, so that that box can be pulled from the stack.<br>
      <br>
      I have scanned various documents from E.209G which are important
      to the Virtual Apollo project, but which aren't available
      elsewhere online, or which are only available in a corrupted form
      elsewhere online.&nbsp; You can find these scans on my <a
        href="links.html">Links page</a>.<br>
      <h2>Finding Aids</h2>
      My goal in sifting through NARA's JSC holdings was, of course, to
      locate versions of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
      and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> (and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Sundisk</span> and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Skylark</span>) software not
      previously available on the web.&nbsp; In this, I was ultimately
      unsuccessful.&nbsp; However, as I expanded my search beyond merely
      the MIT technical documentation described above, I found it
      expedient to create some finding aids that would let me come back
      (perhaps a few months or years) later and retrieve documents from
      NARA that are interesting but not immediately urgent.&nbsp; (The <span
        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">red links</span> were formerly
      not available at this site because of disk-space limitations, but
      should be available now.)<br>

        <li>Miscellaneous AETI:&nbsp; An MSC/JSC-created index of "a
          majority of the pertinent design and development reports
          published by the Apollo spacecraft contractors" also
          exists.&nbsp; This Apollo Engineering and Technology Index
          (AETI) has several flaws:&nbsp; It stops in mid-1968 (and
          hence can't conceivably include much of the software-related
          stuff in which we're interested);&nbsp; it lists documents not
          actually found in the NARA-Southwest archives; there is no
          direct relationship to NARA-Southwest groupings and box
          numbers.&nbsp; But it's very useful nevertheless.&nbsp; The
          AETI exists in 5 parts:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A <a href="NARASWoverflow/CorporateIndex.pdf"
              style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">Corporate Index</a>,
            listing documents by contractor.</li>
          <li>A <a href="NARASWoverflow/CorporateIndexSupplement.pdf"
              style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">supplement</a> to the
            Corporate Index.</li>
          <li>A <a href="NARASWoverflow/SystemsIndex.pdf" style="color:
              rgb(255, 102, 102);">Systems Index</a>, listing documents
            by spacecraft system.</li>
          <li>A <a href="NARASWoverflow/SystemsIndexSupplement.pdf"
              style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">supplement</a> to the
            Systems Index.</li>
          <li>A <a href="NARASWoverflow/ConfigurationIndex.pdf"
              style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">ConfigurationsIndex</a>,
            listing documentation by spacecraft number.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      As you will perceive, these miserable little finding aids barely
      scratch the surface.&nbsp; Perhaps 10-20% of documents are
      covered.&nbsp; Drawings have not been covered at all.<br>
      <h2>Where's the AGC Software?</h2>
      Ideally, I would really like to have is <i>each</i> version of
      the AGC software, including all intermediate versions (hundreds of
      them!), and all off-line development code (essentially, branch
      development).&nbsp; Failing that, I'd like to have just enough
      software to fly each mission ... whereas at the moment I'm writing
      this, we can only "fly" the unmanned Apollo 4-6 missions and the
      manned Apollo 8, 11, and 15-17 missions.&nbsp; Admittedly, since
      those include the first lunar orbital mission, the first lunar
      landing mission, and the last lunar missing, that's not a bad
      selection!&nbsp; And failing that ... well, any AGC version other
      than the versions presently available online!<br>
      <br>
      All of which adds up to precisely nothing, in terms of answering
      the question in the title to this section, because for the most
      part, I don't know how to find the missing versions, or else I
      wouldn't be asking for your help!&nbsp; So all I can really advise
      is to seek and ye may find.&nbsp; And if ye find, pr'thee dost
      tell me.<br>
